## Instruction for setup first communication and future sync local and remote repos
1. Create local repo on computer
2. Connect local and remote repos (git remote add origin "repo's link from github")
3. Push local repo(actual state) to remote(to github) with command (git push), at the same time you will may need to log in
4. Add changes on github repo or from other remote computer(which is connected to github repo too)
